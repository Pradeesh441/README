Projects
1. The main purpose of this project is to find the most appropriate characterization of documents that capture the similar writing style used by another author. This is also known as Authorship Attribution. In the back-end, we have used Machine Learning and Natural Language processing technique called common n-gram model to achieve this goal and in the front-end, we have used HTML, JavaScript and its D3 library for visualization of the data and results.
My task is to work on front end development part using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and its D3 library for visualization of the data and results. D3.js is used for visualizing documents based on data and it provides full capabilities of modern browsers. For visualization, I used many visual elements like bar chart, labeled force layout, clustering, concept map using D3.js to make more interactive and also have to do documentation part for the listed visualization techniques above. Django framework is used as middleware component to connect front-end and back-end. Finally, we got 90% accuracy with execution time about 5 minutes using backend algorithm. At last, I would like to say that the Visualization techniques make understanding of the solution better and much simpler. 
Front-end - HTML, JavaScript and its D3 library for visualization of the data and results.
Back-end - Machine Learning & NLP  technique called Common N-gram Model, 
Django Framework – used to connect Python backend code with Front end

2. The” Noterr “mobile application is the one-stop solution for taking the notes and To-Do's, schedules. There are three important components which are Calendar, Notes, and To-Do. Calendar forms the central part of the application from where the user can have access to the Notes and To-Do.  The Calendar provides the provision to create events and send a reminder notification 10 minutes before the event. 
My task is to work on Calendar part and when the user click a specific date from the calendar the person can view the list of events that were on that day, notes and to-do are taken that day. He/she can go to the notes and to-do item from the same view. The Notes is another important component of the application where the user can take notes. The Notes component provides the provision to select the background color to be assigned for a specific note on creation. Additionally, the user can also attach elements like the image from gallery or from camera and audio files and view the same from the attachments page.
The calendar has the following features
1. General calendar view. 2. On selecting a day, the schedules for that day, To-Do’s and Notes created on that day will be displayed. 3. Navigating to the schedule or To-Do or Notes from the list. 4.Creating a schedule. 5. View the list of schedules, To-Do’s and Notes of particular Day, Week, Month. 6. Send notification of events.

3. We are given with three datasets. The first dataset is based on wordcount that contains many words, the second dataset is based on “National Names” having all details of all the birth names, and the third dataset is based on “Collision Statistics” from 2000-2003 that contains more information related to vehicle collisions from year (2000-2003).
My first task is to choose any one dataset which can support the features of wordcount by removing quotations, comma, case conversation. In the second task, use baby names dataset and capture following information such as Preprocess and clean the dataset, total number of births registered during the year, total number of births registered in a year by gender, and populate 5 most popular names registered that year using Python Spark SQL. The third task is to collision statistics dataset and perform the total incident counts in a year, sum of injuries in Nova Scotia grouped by year, and capture sum of injury in Yarmouth country in the year of 2000 using Spark SQL.
Used : Python Spark SQL, Spark SQL

Inspiration
1. Ember.js is a framework for building web application based on  Model–view–view model (MVVM) pattern and the most important feature is its data binding options. Objects in Ember can able to bind properties to each other, for example, so when a property changes in one object, the other is kept in sync. Another interesting feature of this framework is the ability to define functions on an object and automatically updates its views when data changes which saves lot of work for developers and future generation. 
The most inspiring part in this framework is that is used to organize code into modules and also for creating mock servers for the front end. 
2. Grunt is a JavaScript task runner tool which allows developers automatically to perform tasks such as minification, compilation, and unit testing. This tool uses command line interface to run tasks that is defined by the file name Gruntfile. This is widely used for web developers for easy configuration support and extensive plugin options. The main feature is its customizable and allows developers to add, extend, and modify custom tasks based on personal needs related to JavaScript projects.
The most inspiring thing in this tool is easy to work with new codebase as it contains less infrastructure, and its fast and enhances the performance of the projects.
3. Brackets is a open source text editor written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript with a main focus on web development. This is mostly used for web developers and front end developers which includes innovative features like inline editors that allows users to open the windows when they are working and jumping to different tabs and also offers real time connections within the browser. The advantage of using this text editor is that it is customizable and open source with live preview option.

Focus
I would like to focus my efforts on website development. Since I have previously worked in JAVA, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap I would love to learn more about different web application frameworks and libraries like react.js, vue.js, Ruby on Rails that are emerging today for website development. Moreover, I will learn new things by doing research and watching tutorials related to the particular technology and how I could implement those features for future development. I will try to spend time learning node.js, ember.js and few emerging web technologies as well. This way I can learn myself and contribute my technical skills to team project implementation, testing, and deployment of web application, attending team meetings thus helping the company to succeed in future.

Code Challenge
At first, remove function is created to remove all the instances of a specified topping from a provided array. In order to return all the values of an array .filter() method is used to remove the items from the list. Second, de_duplication function is used to pass the toppings array. Then arr.indexOf(elements) is used to search the specific array in order to return its position. In the next step, create_List function is created to list all the items and document.createDocumentFragment() is used to create node items from toppings list. append() method is used to add all the list of elements from array. Finally, pineapple is removed from the topping list from the given array.
